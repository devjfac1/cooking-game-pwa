  - Simple: Single ingredient dishes
  - Complex: Multi-ingredient recipes
  - Special: Time-sensitive or bonus dishes
- **Order Components**:
  - Main ingredient
  - Cooking method (grill, fry, bake)
  - Preparation time
  - Special requirements (temperature, presentation)

### Preparation Mechanics

## Scoring System

### Base Scoring
- **Speed Bonus**: Points based on completion time vs. target time
- **Accuracy Bonus**: Perfect preparation = full points
- **Presentation Bonus**: Visual appeal affects score

### Advanced Scoring
- **Combo System**: Consecutive perfect orders increase multiplier
- **Skill Multipliers**:
  - Speed: Fast completion bonus
  - Efficiency: Minimal waste bonus
  - Creativity: Unique preparation methods
- **Penalty System**:

  - Incorrect dishes: Partial credit
  - Customer dissatisfaction: Reputation loss

### Score Calculation Formula
```
Final Score = Base Points × Speed Multiplier × Accuracy Multiplier × Combo Multiplier
```
